Creating a Recommendation System Model Using Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering with TensorFlow in Python

Project Overview
Bengaluru is a paradise for food lovers. The number of restaurants is increasing daily, with approximately 12,000 restaurants currently in operation. Despite this high number, the industry is not yet saturated, and new restaurants open every day. However, it has become challenging for new establishments to compete with well-established ones.

This dataset aims to analyze the demographic locations of restaurants. Most importantly, it will help new restaurants determine the theme, menu, cuisine, etc., for specific locations. Additionally, it seeks to find similarities between different neighborhoods in Bengaluru based on their food offerings.
